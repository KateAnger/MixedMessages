not sure if this is going to work

how does the branch adding work (locally and/or remotely) and why could i now 
create a branch called main and not when i set up the remote push?

So when I first created the repository on GitHub, the code provided to push an 
existing local repository didn't work - i.e. it wouldn't let me create a new 
branch called main and push that. It did before when I was practicing in the 
tutorials so I obviously did something that I shouldn't have done. Can't 
remember error - it has gone now - but something to do with refs ... As the 
project recommends working in a seperate branch and thenm merging with main 
later, I kind of needed to fix this. So I added a branch in GitHub but then 
it wouldn't be local. So I deleted that. Seperately, with git checkout -b main 
created a new branch (does that change to main straight away as opposed to 
master?) and then committed that - with this file - and now it seems to match 
up on GitHub.
